<h1>ERP Failure Library</h1>

<p>
This library documents publicly reported ERP implementation failures using
primary evidence sources only, including court filings, government audit reports,
and Tier-1 financial media. Entries record outcomes and reported facts without
asserting intent, fault, or misconduct beyond cited sources.
</p>

<h2>Evidence Standards</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Primary sources only (court records, government audits, official filings)</li>
  <li>Tier-1 financial media where primary documents are unavailable</li>
  <li>No vendor opinions, marketing material, or blog sources</li>
  <li>Neutral language focused on outcomes, costs, and timelines</li>
</ul>

This library is not exhaustive. Entries are added only when verifiable documentation
meets the evidence standards defined above. Absence of an organization or system
does not imply success or failure.
